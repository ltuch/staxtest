Example which demonstrates the stripping of invalid XML characters when using the Woodstox XML parser.

This is used to demonstrate a workaround to the problem described at https://github.com/FasterXML/woodstox/issues/37.

TODO: investigate a better solution as this doesn't work for UTF-16 encoding.
